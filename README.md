# Basic Static-Dynamic Malware Analysis

Malware analysis is the process of understanding the behaviour and purpose of a suspicious file or URL. The output of the analysis aids in the detection and mitigation of the potential threat.

## Malware Sample

> **MD5:**  1d8562c0adcaee734d63f7baaca02f7c

> **SHA256:**  92730427321a1c4ccfc0d0580834daef98121efa9bb8963da332bfd6cf1fda8a


## Basic Static Analysis :

### Hashing Malware Sample

- Getting File Hash is important part of Static Analysis. We will use this hash to check reputation of binary  on multiple automated sandbox like VirusTotal.

### Malware Repositories

- The very first technique in static analysis is to upload the suspicious executable or hash on VirusTotal, which runs the executable against several AV solutions and gives the result. For example, the below file states that the detection ratio is 46 out of 70.

- You can check the below output, Multiple AV solutions  detected  our sample as a Trojan.

### String Analysis

- Searching through the strings can be a simple way to get hints about the functionality of a program. For example, if the program accesses a URL, then you will see the URL accessed stored as a string in the program.

- Below is a string extraction of keywords from a malicious executable. As we can see, it gives us good information that URL, File Path and Commands.

- From the below strings output we can assume that malware connecting to external URL to download file.
